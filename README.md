# Project Name: Spark-Spring-Data

## Description
This project integrates Apache Spark with Spring Data, offering a seamless bridge between big data processing and Spring-based application development. By leveraging Spark's powerful distributed computing capabilities and Spring's robust framework for building enterprise applications, developers can efficiently manage and analyze large datasets while maintaining the flexibility and scalability of Spring-based applications.

## Features
- **SparkRepository Interface:** Extends the `public interface SparkRepository<M>` for easy integration with Spring Data, providing a familiar repository pattern for interacting with Spark datasets.
- **Support for Multiple Formats:** This project supports various data formats including JSON, CSV, and more, enabling seamless data ingestion and processing.

## Usage
1. Extend your repository interfaces from `SparkRepository<M>` to leverage Spark's distributed computing capabilities within your Spring Data repositories.
    ```java
    public interface MySparkRepository extends SparkRepository<MyEntity> {
        // Define custom query methods here
    }
    ```

2. Use Spring's dependency injection to inject your Spark repositories into your Spring components and services.
    ```java
    @Service
    public class MyService {
        
        @Autowired
        private MySparkRepository mySparkRepository;
        
        // Use repository methods as needed
    }
    ```

## TODO
- Enhance functionality to support additional data formats and serialization methods.
- Improve documentation and examples for seamless integration with Spring Boot applications.
